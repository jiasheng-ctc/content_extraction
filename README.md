# Scanned PDF Extraction App

## Overview

This app processes scanned PDF files to extract structured information using the **Rhubarb framework** integrated with **AWS Bedrock**. It simplifies handling unstructured documents like loan agreements, contracts, or invoices by combining OCR, entity recognition, summarization, and masking into a single workflow.

## Workflow

1. **Input**: User provides the path to a scanned PDF file.
2. **Processing**:
   - The app converts the PDF into images for each page.
   - OCR is applied to extract text from the images.
3. **Entity Extraction**: Rhubarb identifies key details like:
   - Borrower and co-borrower names
   - Loan account numbers
   - Dates (e.g., signing date)
   - Addresses (e.g., place of signing)
4. **Summarization**: A concise summary of the document is generated, focusing on important details such as loan terms and borrower information.
5. **Masking**: Sensitive data (e.g., loan account numbers) is replaced with placeholders for privacy.
6. **Output**: The results include:
   - Extracted entities in a structured format
   - A summary of the document
   - Masked sensitive text
